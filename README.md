# Health Statistics Logger

### Log Daily Health and Analyse Progress Graphically

This application aims to be a tool that is used to ***log daily health statistics***
such as **body mass, body muscle, body fat percentage and body water percentage.**
This can then be used to track BMI progress and changes in these statistics using graphs.


#### **This application is intended for:**
- users checking progress while **bulking/cutting at the gym**
- users ***trying various diets*** and monitoring changes
- users ***casually monitoring body health*** statistics


#### Why This Project is of interest to me:
This project is of interest to me because when I started going to the gym 
and started monitoring my daily diet, I would have greatly benefited from 
an application which would perform the tasks that this aims to achieve.

I believe this application would be a great asset to anyone just casually starting to 
monitor health statistics or even already working out and want to measure
their progress with ease.
